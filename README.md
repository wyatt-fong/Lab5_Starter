1. No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature for a messaging application because the number of components. These components include the UI, network connection (communication), and backend features. Testing this feature would require how each of these components wouldl woork with one another which is more fit for an integration test rather than a unit test. If we wanted to test one aspect of the message feature such as UI, then we could perhaps use units tests. But to test the "message" feature in its entirety does not fit within the unit tests uses.
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging applcation. This is because we are only testiong one aspect of the "message" feature rather than testing the entire thing. With the "max message length" we can just check whether or nor the logic identifies when a message is too long and what the response will be if it happens. It's a simple and concise feature that we need tested, perfect for the unit test.
